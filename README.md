Hello everyone! I'm **Daniela Morales** 🙋‍♀️ I'm a software engineering student 💻 and I'm currently in my fourth semester. I really like to solve problems, 
I consider myself a curious person who likes to learn something new every day⚡.

One of my favorite things to do in my free time is to read and paint pictures.
